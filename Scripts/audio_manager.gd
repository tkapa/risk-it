extends Node2D
## Audio manager node. Inteded to be globally loaded as a 2D Scene. Handles [method create_2d_audio_at_location()] and [method create_audio()] to handle the playback and culling of simultaneous sound effects.
##
## To properly use, define [enum SoundEffect.SOUND_EFFECT_TYPE] for each unique sound effect, create a Node2D scene for this AudioManager script add those SoundEffect resources to this globally loaded script's [member sound_effects], and setup your individual SoundEffect resources. Then, use [method create_2d_audio_at_location()] and [method create_audio()] to play those sound effects either at a specific location or globally.
